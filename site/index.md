# What is Pyprland?

It's a software that extends the functionality of your desktop environment (Hyprland, Niri, etc...), adding new features and improving the existing ones.

It also enables a high degree of customization and automation, making it easier to adapt to your workflow.

To understand the potential of Pyprland, you can check the [plugins](./Plugins) page.

# Major recent changes

- Major rewrite of the [Monitors plugin](/monitors) delivers improved stability and functionality.
- The [Wallpapers plugin](/wallpapers) now applies [rounded corners](/wallpapers#radius) per display and derives cohesive [color schemes from the background](/wallpapers#templates) (Matugen/Pywal-inspired).
