# fetch_client_menu

Bring any window to the active workspace using a menu.

A bit like the [expose](./expose) plugin but using a menu instead (less intrusive).

It brings the window to the current workspace, while [expose](./expose) moves the currently focused screen to the application workspace.

## Commands

<PluginCommands plugin="fetch_client_menu" />

## Configuration

All the [Menu](./Menu) configuration items are also available.

<PluginConfig plugin="fetch_client_menu" linkPrefix="config-" />
